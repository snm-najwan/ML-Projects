# ML-Projects

This is a Machine Learning Project in which I have built a Regression Model to Predict Housing Prices based on the features such as Bedroom Count, Net Square (m^2), distance from nearest Metro Station, diatance from nearest Centre, Age of the Housing, and the Floor number from ground. This is not a real pricing plans of any city and this is a sample dataset from Kaggle. I have used performed data cleaning, data preprocessing, data visualization, model training, model development, and model evaluation in this particular project.
